  JavaScript and CSS can work together to enhance the visual appearance and behavior of web pages. JavaScript can be used to modify CSS properties dynamically, apply styles conditionally, and toggle classes on elements based on user interactions or other events. By combining JavaScript and CSS, you can create engaging animations, responsive designs, and interactive features that enhance the user experience.
