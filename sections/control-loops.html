  Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. JavaScript offers various control flow statements, such as <code>if</code> statements, <code>switch</code> statements, and loops (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do...while</code>). Conditional statements like <code>if</code> allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Loops enable repetitive execution of a block of code until a certain condition is met.
