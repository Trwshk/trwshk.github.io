  JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It was originally designed to run in web browsers but has now expanded its reach to server-side development and other platforms. JavaScript allows developers to manipulate web page elements, handle events, perform calculations, and interact with APIs.
