  In JavaScript, there are several built-in data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold different types of values at different times. Variables are declared using the <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> keyword, and their values can be assigned, updated, and accessed throughout the program.
