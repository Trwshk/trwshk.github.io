  The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. JavaScript provides powerful features to manipulate the DOM, allowing you to dynamically modify the content, structure, and styles of a web page. You can access and modify HTML elements, change their attributes, add or remove elements, handle events, and create interactive user experiences. DOM manipulation is commonly used to create dynamic web applications and enhance the interactivity of websites.
