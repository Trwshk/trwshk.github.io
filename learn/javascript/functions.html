  Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They encapsulate a series of instructions and can accept input parameters and return a value. Functions help in code organization, modularity, and reusability. In JavaScript, you can define functions using function declarations or function expressions. Parameters allow you to pass data into a function, and the return statement allows the function to provide a result back to the caller.
