  Arrays and objects are complex data types that allow you to store and manipulate collections of values in JavaScript. Arrays are ordered lists of values, while objects are collections of key-value pairs. You can perform various operations on arrays, such as accessing elements, adding or removing items, and iterating over them using loops or array methods. Objects allow you to represent more complex data structures and organize related properties and methods.
