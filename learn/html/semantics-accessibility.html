  HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide meaningful structure and improve accessibility. Semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt; help define the different sections of a webpage. They assist search engines in understanding the content and provide better context to assistive technologies. Adhering to semantic HTML practices enhances the overall quality and accessibility of your web pages.
