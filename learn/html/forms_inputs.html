  Forms are used to collect user input on a webpage, such as submitting contact information or processing user-generated content. HTML provides form elements like &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; to create various types of input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and submit buttons. Understanding how to structure and validate form inputs is crucial for building interactive web forms.
