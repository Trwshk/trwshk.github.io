  Lists and tables are essential for organizing and presenting data on a webpage. HTML offers two types of lists: ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) and unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;). Ordered lists display items in a numbered format, while unordered lists use bullet points. Tables (&lt;table&gt;) are used to display tabular data, with rows defined by the &lt;tr&gt; tag and cells within each row defined by &lt;td&gt; or &lt;th&gt; tags.
