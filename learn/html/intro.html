  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications. It provides the structure and semantic meaning of the content on a webpage. HTML uses a set of tags to define the elements within a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more. Understanding HTML is essential for building the foundation of any web development project.
