  HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define the structure and organization of the content. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) and are usually represented by a pair of opening and closing tags. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, while the closing tag marks its end. Understanding the proper use of tags and their nesting structure is crucial for creating well-formed HTML documents.
