  HTML allows you to embed images and create hyperlinks to other web pages or external resources. The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to insert images, and it requires the "src" attribute to specify the image file's source location. Hyperlinks are created using the &lt;a&gt; tag, with the "href" attribute defining the destination URL. By using images and links effectively, you can enhance the interactivity and engagement of your web pages.
