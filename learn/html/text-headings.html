  HTML provides various tags to display and format text content. Heading tags (h1 to h6) are used to define different levels of headings, with h1 being the highest and h6 the lowest. Paragraph tags (&lt;p&gt;) are used to enclose paragraphs of text. Additionally, HTML offers tags like &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, &lt;s&gt;, and &lt;blockquote&gt; to apply formatting, emphasize text, and create block-level quotations.
