  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format HTML elements. By applying CSS properties and values, you can control the appearance of text, backgrounds, margins, padding, and more. Selectors are used to target specific elements or groups of elements to apply styles. Understanding the integration of CSS with HTML is crucial for achieving visually appealing and consistent designs.
