  Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful layout systems introduced in CSS3. Flexbox provides a one-dimensional layout, allowing you to create flexible and responsive designs. CSS Grid enables two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define rows and columns for organizing content. Understanding and utilizing these layout systems can simplify the process of creating complex and responsive page structures.
