  Responsive design is an approach that aims to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS media queries enable you to apply specific styles based on the user's device characteristics, such as screen width, height, and orientation. By designing responsive layouts and using media queries effectively, you can ensure that your web pages look and function well across various devices.
