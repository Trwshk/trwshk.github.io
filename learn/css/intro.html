  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows you to define styles for individual elements or groups of elements, making it easier to maintain consistent design across multiple web pages. By separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), you can create visually appealing and responsive web pages.
