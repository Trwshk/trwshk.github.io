  CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements for applying styles. Selectors can be based on element names, class names, IDs, attributes, and more. Understanding the various selector types and their specificity is important for styling elements accurately. CSS properties like color, font-size, margin, padding, and background-color are used to modify the appearance of elements.
