  The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines how elements are rendered on a webpage. Each element is treated as a rectangular box, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the spacing, sizing, and positioning of elements. CSS offers properties like width, height, margin, padding, and border to manipulate the box model.
