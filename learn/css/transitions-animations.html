  CSS transitions and animations allow you to add dynamic and interactive effects to elements on a webpage. Transitions smoothly animate property changes when triggered by user actions or state changes. Animations provide more complex and custom animations, allowing you to define keyframes and timing functions. Leveraging CSS transitions and animations can greatly enhance the user experience of your web pages.
